# Viral Content

A shopping cart system for purchasing "viral content." The cart operates on what I call "Interest-Based Pricing," meaning that the more interested you are, the faster the price increases. Being on the page at all is a sign of interest, so all the prices are increasing a bit right from the start. 

Every interaction after that — viewing an image, adding it to the cart, trying to remove it from the cart, entering you card info — it all shows more and more interest. It's very terrible. I call it "Hell Cart." This is easily the most awful thing I have ever made.

All of this is just me experimenting with React, which I just recently learned. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
